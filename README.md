# PDFFormOCR

This repository contains the initial setup for the **PDFFormOCR** project. The
aim of the project is to extract text from PDF forms using optical character
recognition (OCR).

At this stage the repository only includes this README. Implementation code has
not been committed yet. The final code is intended to include scripts that:

- Convert PDF pages to images
- Run OCR on those images
- Parse the text results into a structured format

Until those features are added, this repository serves as a placeholder for
future development.
